## 🚀 About Me
Hi! So about me, I'm a full stack developer, I code mainly for fun
but I also take commision work, I'd say I'm Intermediate in my level with Python and rapidly approaching Advanced level! ^^ (Looking forward to that day lol)

🧠 I'm currently learning Neural Networks!

👯‍♀️ Eager to collaborate on the backend code – it's where the magic happens! ✨

🤔 Seeking guidance on the mystical art of creating a Neural Network – any wizards out there? 😄

💬 Ask me anything excluding childhood; I'm an open book! ^^
